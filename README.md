FileViewerScreenComponentFlow

***Credit*** to Salesforce Troop for creating the basis to this component and explaining how NavigationMixin is the keyto the function.

Meant to be used in a Salesforce flow as a screen component. Takes ANY custom object recordId as a input and extracts all ContentDocumentLinks associated with the record.
Use either directly in a lightning Page or on a quick action with recordId as the input to the flow dynamically.
